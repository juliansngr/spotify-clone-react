# Spotify Clone Project

### Objective:

Creating a **Spotify** clone using **React** with the following functionality:

- Play & Pause Audio
- Interactive playbar, indicating the track progress and letting the user scroll through the running track
- Track selection
- Skip to the next track, revert to the previous track
- Volume slider
